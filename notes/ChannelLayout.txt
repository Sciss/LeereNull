To better match with the defaults of OS X both Audio MIDI Setup and QuickTime Player 7 configuration naming (Quad), the channel layout is slightly unorthodox:

Channel 1 = Front Left
Channel 2 = Front Right
Channel 3 = Rear Left (!)
Channel 4 = Rear Right (!)

So 'X-shaped' instead of clockwise circle.
