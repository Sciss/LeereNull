nice would be to come in and go out again;
thus to impose a grid step by step on
the layers using segm

David pointed me out to this one:

A pure 'negative' attitude -- restricting my own 'manual' interference to rejecting sounds.

Komposition in Schichten

I like the matching of the silences yielding all sorts of barely audible background sounds

::::::::::::::::: (04-Feb-12)

You get a very _specific_ modulation of colour

There is like an archetype sound in each layer, as if each layer wanted to be a piece on its own

Feel like painting

It's all a verification of the 'subtractive' hypothesis

n-imit 2 : 3'39ff

:::::::::::::::::

this creative 'dialogue' where it is my freedom to reveal the sounds that have been chopped off. (not being able to establish cause and effect)

:::::::::::::::::

Also a somewhat sad experience, because each layer is like wanting to be a piece on its own because of their delicacy... Cage, ungehinderte Durchdringung

Simple things, like the beginning of Ch-1 in UeberEco1 -- Pfefferwerk blending into Atem --, are so phantastic, still a human mind wandering over the sound database would most likely not come up with it...

(or even more surprising: Aves -> dBArch @ 4'29")

(or the harmonic-melodic conincidence with flageo vs. litho at 4'40" which is more result of the loudness contour I guess)

(or the combination of five absolutely distinct sources, Ch-4 @ 3'36" AgnDm'mpHlb... versus Einseifen versus SiedenderTee versus NoisePeak... versus Trk3... and back to Einseifen; absolutely brilliant)

Also the appearance of snippets from sound that I would probably not have considered in the first place.

:::::::::::::::::

It virtually screams for a miniature spin-off project
(Eco1 Ch-2 from 3'50")

:::::::::::::::::

Also, as a colour mixer

:::::::::::::::::

And also, the early Schaefferian fun
(Eco 6 Ch 1 beginning)
