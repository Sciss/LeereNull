raspad cut 1 is extended to the left! at 34.533" it has a file offset of 3.214",
compared to a file offset of 05.622" for the first appearance (at 15.662")

; however it occupies a space which was previously used for the cut 2
; that is, Session9 is a more visible version of what the original process was

it seems that from Session9, quasi one iteration 34.355" ... 41.341" has been skipped...

max stops:
Gesture1ConGesture2 : 26.546" with 1st raspad at 15.662" = 11 secs

::::::::::::

if we title 'part 2', we also should add another 'part 1' title, which is nice, because it can have a subtitle as well.

Part 1
 expand / contract
forward / backward

(or merely expand -> contract, where contract is horizonally mirrored)

- the 'part 1' can sit between the video and the first sonogram, better freeing the mind from being too stuck with the video image.

Part 2
 imitation -> ecology

// should we have nouns for part 1, too (expansion -> contraction) ? not necessarily...
// ; the difference in a way reflects the aesthetic diffence between the more formalist
// 'programme' (time!) and the more reclined observation (space!)
